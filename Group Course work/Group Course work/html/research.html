        <p style="font-size: x-large;">Introduction of printers</p>
        <p>A printer is a peripheral device designed to reproduce digital content in physical form by transferring text, images, 
            or graphics to paper or other media. There are different types of printers that use different technologies to achieve
             specific printing requirements. Common types include inkjet printers, which use liquid ink for high-quality color printing. 
             Laser printer. It uses toner and laser beam for fast and accurate black and white printing. A dot matrix printer that uses 
             punching pins to create characters. Printers play an important role in personal and professional settings, allowing us to convert
              electronic data into tangible documents, photos, and other physical representations.</p>

<!-- Article about Tools used in your website -->
<article>
    <h1>Tools used in our website</h1>
     <!-- Content about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript usage -->
<p>HTML</p>
   <p>In the coursework on developing a eShop for printers,  HTML is used as a primary web coding language. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language,
     provides a structured and necessary foundation for creating eShop websites. It allows to define the structure and content of the pages, 
     including elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists and images. HTML tags were used to organize information such as printer specifications, 
     prices and images in a clear and coherent way. In addition, HTML allows the creation of interactive elements such as buttons and forms, making 
     it easier for users to engage with the eShop platform. By harnessing the power of HTML, we can ensure a standardized and accessible presentation
     of print products, contributing to a seamless and user-friendly online shopping experience for customers visiting the eShop. </p>
 <p>CSS</p>
 <p>For developing the coursework for a printer eShop, Combination of inline, external, and internal CSS were strategically employed to enhance the presentation 
    and user experience of the website. Inline styles were utilized for specific elements where immediate styling was required, allowing to tailor the appearance
     of individual components within the HTML document. For a more organized approach, internal styles were embedded in the HTML head section, enabling me to define 
     consistent styling for various elements throughout the eShop. Additionally, external styles proved invaluable in maintaining a cohesive design across multiple pages.
      By creating a separate CSS file linked to the HTML documents, I ensured a streamlined and easily maintainable structure for the entire printer eShop project. This 
      approach not only facilitated efficient coding but also allowed for a modular and scalable design, contributing to
     a visually appealing and user-friendly online shopping experience for customers exploring the printer eShop.</p>
<p>Javascript</p>
<p>In the development of the coursework focused on a printer eShop, JavaScript played a pivotal role in adding dynamic functionality and interactivity to 
    the website. Leveraging JavaScript, We implemented features such as product filtering based on user preferences, dynamic content updates without page reloads,
     and form validation to enhance the overall user experience. Through event handling and DOM manipulation, we ensured seamless interaction with the eShop, allowing 
     users to effortlessly navigate product categories and access detailed information. Furthermore, JavaScript facilitated the integration of secure payment gateways 
     and real-time updates on product availability. By incorporating this versatile scripting language, we aimed to create a responsive and engaging printer eShop that not 
     only showcases products effectively but also provides a user-friendly interface for an optimal online shopping experience.</p>
